											<p>Problem: As a gamer, it can be hard to keep track of games they have played or would like to play.</p>
											<p>Our Solution: We wanted to create an app where users can store critical information of the games they have played and the games that they want to play.</p>

											<p>Problem: During fantasy football season, it can be hard to easily find stats on football players.</p>
											<p>Our Solution: We wanted to allow the user to analyze, research and track sports statistics for players and teams.</p>

											<p>Problem: As an investor or someone curious about stocks, it can be hard to search what people are tweeting about on a particular stock.</p>
											<p>My Solution: I created this app to allow users to be able to quickly view tweets based on the stock symbol searched as well as give the user the ability to save stock info.</p>
										</div>

											<a href="https://github.com/TRose2014/remember-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="image fit"><img src="images/Remember-Me-2.png" alt="Screenshot of remember me home page"></a>
											<p>Problem: After the death of George Floyd, I wanted to ensure that those we lost at the hands of police brutality would always be remembered.</p>
											<p>My Solution: This app allows users to view those we lost to police brutality. Additionally, this app focuses on their lives and not so much on how they died.</p>

										<h2>More About Me</h2>
										<p>Before discovering the wonderful world of coding, I used to work in the banking industry for over 5 years. I did it all, from account set-up to mortgage applications. But after a while, I knew I wanted something more from my career. It wasn't until I had my daughter that I decided to take the plunge and dive head first into teaching myself programming. Eventually my diligence paid off and I became part of a great program called <span><a href="https://apprenticareers.org/">Apprenti</a></span>. I then survived 5 months of extreme technical training, earning the right to call myself an Apprentice Software Developer. When I am not coding, I love to travel, beat my husband in video games, and convince my toddler that there are more words in the English language other than no. I am always working on something new so be sure to come back and check them out.</p>
